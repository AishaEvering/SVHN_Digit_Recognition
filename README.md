## 📃Description

The model employs sophisticated Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it endeavors to discern numerical characters within the famous SVHN (Street View House Numbers) Dataset.


## 🏫 What Did I Learn

* How to build and train a ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model.
* How to build and train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* If the training accracy is rising while the validation accuracy is declining that baby is overfitting.


### 😤 Where I Got Stuck

* Honestly, I dont' think I got stuck anywhere in this project.

### ☑️ Todos...

* None
  
### 📖 Dataset

* The [SVHN dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)
  
## 🙏 Acknowledgments

* These projects are evaluated by the Great Learning/MIT staff and this is some of what I was told. 😊

*"Your project submission is truly exceptional. Your meticulous efforts are evident in the comprehensive evaluation of each segment, demonstrating a profound level of dedication.
