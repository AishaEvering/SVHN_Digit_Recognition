# Face Verification (YouTube Tutorial) :youtube

This is the result of an 8 part YouTube series of using Deep Learning with TensorFlow to authenicate your face much like on IPhone.  *Pretty Cool.*

## üìÉDescription

This is a TensorFlow neural network model that performs computer vision to authenticate an image.

## üè´ What Did I Learn

* How to use Tensor flow decoraters.
* How to create a custom training step using TensorFlow.

## üîë Key Takeaways

This is my first experience with following a research paper's neural network archetecture.  Some of the cool takeways I got from it where
* One Shot: The model must correctly make predictionss given only a single example.  The model was trained on hundreds of images of my face (positive) and randomn faces (negative). Then the model was given a single single (one-shot) image and validated it against a validation image.  Depending on the verfiication threshold which in the case was 70% the model verified that if the person in the image was the same person if the given image.
* This model used the siamese neural network method that took in 2 inputs and ranked the similarity.


### üò§ Where I Got Stuck

* OpenCV opening the web camera does not work in Google Colab.  There is a snippet available on Google Colab that takes a single picture from the web camera, but I needed hundreds.  So I took a little detour and updated the code to work like OpenCV did in the tutorial.  I even wrote about it, check it out.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Todos...

* Deploy the model so it can easily verfiy faces.
  
### üìñ Dataset

* ~400 Anchor images taken with my webcam.  They are currently stored in my Google Drive.
* ~400 Positive images taken with my webcam.  They are currently store in my Google Drive.
* ~400 Negatvie images provided my tutorial, labled Faces in the Wild.
